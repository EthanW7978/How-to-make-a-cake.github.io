            <h2>About the Recipe</h2>
            <p>I don't really know anything about cake, but I like strawberries and cake, so I wanted to research how to make a strawberry-choclate-cake. I got this recipe from cambrea bakes "https://cambreabakes.com/chocolate-strawberry-cake/"</p>
            <p>Some fun facts about cake in general is that 1. The world's largest cake weighed over 64 tons(created in 2005). 2. Cakes used to be a symbol of luck and not dessert. 3. Cake flavors reflect cultural history. </p>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Combine the dry ingredients. Combine the dry ingredients in a stand mixer. Mix in the butter on low speed until it resembles coarse sand.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Combine the wet ingredients. Whisk the sour cream, eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Mix in half of the wet ingredients. Pour half the wet ingredients into the bowl and mix on low speed for exactly 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Mix in the coffee. Mix in the rest of the wet ingredients until just combined. Scrape down the bowl. Then mix in the hot coffee.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Bake the cake layers. Distribute the chocolate cake batter into the prepared cake pans. After baking, cool the pans on a wire rack while you make the filling.</li>
            <li>Step 6: Make the strawberry filling. Cook the strawberries, lemon juice, and water, mashing occasionally—reserve 1/4 cup for the frosting. Then mix in the sugar and cornstarch slurry. Cook until thickened, then set aside.</li>
            <li>Step 7: Make the strawberry buttercream frosting. Beat the butter, powdered sugar, reserved strawberries, vanilla extract, and heavy cream until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Step 8: Fill the chocolate cake with strawberry filling. Pipe a border of buttercream around the edge of the cake. Then, spread half of the strawberry filling in the center.</li>
            <li>Step 9: Assemble the cake layers. Continue stacking and alternating layers of cake, filling, and frosting, placing the last cake layer upside down so the top of the cake is flat.</li>
            <li>Step 10: Cover with strawberry frosting. Use the remaining buttercream to cover the top and sides of the cake. If you prefer a thicker layer of frosting, you will need to make 1.5x or 2x the frosting recipe!</li>
            <li>Step 11: Make the chocolate ganache. Chill the cake in the fridge while you make the ganache. Pour the hot, heavy cream over the chocolate and stir to emulsify. Wait 5-10 minutes before using it so you don’t melt the frosting!</li>
            <li>Step 12: Decorate the cake. Pour the ganache on the cake and spread it over the edges with an offset spatula. Let it set, then garnish the chocolate cake with strawberries and chocolate pieces.</li>
